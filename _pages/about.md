<b>Academy Research Fellow: Accurate Imaging with Sound and Light (AI-SOL) </b><br>
The project will concentrate on providing necessary methodological advances to enable large-scale 3D photoacoustic imaging for in vivo applications. 
The funding will allow for one PhD student within the project, related announcements will follow. 
The news from the academy can be found here:
