<b>AequiLoFi: Accurate quantitative imaging with open-source open hardware low-field MRI  </b><br>
A new Research Council of Finland project has been funded! Together with Mikko Nissi we will build low-field MRI systems and develop robust inversion
techniques for quantitative MRI with low-cost hardware solutions:

<b>Learned Reconstruction Methods With Convergence Guarantees: A survey of concepts and applications</b><br>
In our new survey paper published in the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, we discuss learned image reconstruction methods that come with convergence guarantees. 
Helping us to understand these methods theoretically and challenging the notion that learned approaches are pure black-boxes:

<b>Nuorten Tiedeakatemia - Young Academy Finland</b><br>
I am honoured to be elected as member of the Young Academy of Finland for a 4 year term. 
<u><a href="{{"https://nuortentiedeakatemia.fi/2022/06/08/nuorten-tiedeakatemiaan-22-uutta-jasenta-joukossa-avoimen-jasenhaun-kautta-loytyneita-ehdokkaita/"}}">(link)</a>.</u>


<b>Academy Research Fellow: Accurate Imaging with Sound and Light (AI-SOL) </b><br>
The project will concentrate on providing necessary methodological advances to enable large-scale 3D photoacoustic imaging for in vivo applications. 
The funding will allow for one PhD student within the project, related announcements will follow. 
The news from the academy can be found here:

<b>Deep learning in photoacoustic tomography: current approaches and future directions</b><br>
Our review with Ben Cox is published in the journal for biomedical optics.
We put learned image reconstruction within photoacoustic tomography into context, review different approaches and provide a tutorial style introduction for others who want to get started.

<b>Sawing Optimization via Deep Learning and Multi-instrument Imaging</b><br>
New grant approved by the Academy of Finland for a 2 year project (2020-2022) with Lassi Roininen (LUT) and Ozan Ã–ktem (KTH) on 
optimizing sawing patterns to improve sustainability in the sawing industry.
